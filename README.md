# The Alpine Mathematics Historical Proofs Archive

Like a database of great chess games, this Proofscape repo aims to
represent the great proofs of the past, and thereby support annotations,
commentary, and discussion, by anyone who loves to study proofs.


## What's in the library?

The vision is that the library should encompass works by mathematicians
like those apt to be listed under the [MacTutor](https://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/)
biographies. It should cover classic works of historical significance.

In terms of Proofscape concepts, the modules in this library contain
_only deductions_ (no annotations). These deductions
represent only theorems and proofs _from the literature_ (no expansions).

However, we are encouraged to record _comparisons_ on the nodes in this library.
These are akin to the editorial footnotes or cross-references often found in
collected works.


## What about everything else?

So then what about everything else you
can do in Proofscape, like expansions and annotations?

You can start by checking out some of our other Proofscape repos:

* [gh.alpinemath.ex](https://github.com/alpinemath/ex): expansions and example
  explorers
* [gh.alpinemath.en](https://github.com/alpinemath/en): English translations

each of which invites contributions.

But ultimately it's completely up to you. Studying mathematics? Why not start
your own Proofscape repo in which to record (and share) your notes?
Feeling more ambitious? Why not develop your own interactive textbook?


## How to contribute?

Contributing is easy. Basically, just fork this repository, add or improve some
modules, and make a pull request. However, please be sure to read the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first, and follow the guidelines stated
there.

The easiest way to develop Proofscape modules is by
[downloading and running PISE](https://alpinemath.org/download/pise.html),
the Proofscape Integrated Study Environment, on your own computer.

For an intro to PISE, you might want to try out
